# A-study-on-Crypto-Identity-System-Using-Blockchain
A project on how we can implement Blockchain to secure any person identity system like SSN,
so that it can be made more secure and free from identity theft. For the implementation,
I have created a Ethereum test net on both Ganache and deployed a smart contract on it to verify that it works.

This project contains a PDf documentation which contains a details step by step procedure on how to create a blockchain using Ganache and how to create a smart contract and deploy on the the created blockchain on Etheruem Wallet.
